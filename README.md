# AndroidBoosterWeek4Task
This project was created as a task required for week 4 of **Sprints' Android Development Booster 4**.\
The goal of the project was to create an Android app to display some data about movies from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) using their provided API.\
The project was written in Kotlin and can run on **Android 5.0 - Lollipop or higher**.
## Features
The application is able to retrieve data about most popular and top rated movies on their database, which is updated hourly according to their API documentation.
This data shown in the main screen of each movie is the movie title, poster, and rating.\
\
If the user clicks on the movie, a new screen opens containing additional data about the movie such as an overview of it, its release date, and its original language.
### Known Bugs
A small bug can be noticed when scrolling down too fast. This sometimes causes the list to jump to the top which can be a bit troublesome. It only occurs when the user decides to scroll down before more data is loaded so it should not bother the majority of users.
